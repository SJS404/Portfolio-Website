                    <p>This website was designed from the base up. I created this to both expand my knowledge of hard coding a website, as well as to have a platform to showcase any past or future projects i may undertake. This webiste is a work in progress, and any feedback is welcome.</p>
                
                    <p>I coded this website to move away from the traditional paper resume and CV, and to also create a project that I could use my previous web development skill and organisational skills into effect. The website serves as both my professional resume and also a place I can consolidate my projects and working experience all into one place, that is accessible to both prospective clients, employers or people looking to collaborate. It will remain an ongoing project and updated with relevant information.</p>

                    <p>Whilst studying my Level 3 Diploma at The Manchester College, I was introduced further into the world of HTML5 & CSS3 then I had previously seen. This was quite intriguing to myself and I enjoyed the module this was in very much. That is when I decided to hardcode this portfolio website instead of using the before mentioned website builders.</p>
                    
                    <p>When approaching this project, I needed to sit down and think about my previous career, places and I have worked and also any transferrable skills that I had learnt along the way. This would help in the content of the website and would allow me to identify the skills I had learned in the Hospitality Industry and Customer Service, and apply this in the IT Industry more effectively.</p>

                    <p>To design and code the website UI I decided to use VS Code as my IDE (Integrated Development Environment) as I had used this previously and found it useful for spinning up a Live Server to see any changes in real-time along the development process. Previously, I have designed and built website for small businesses such as where I worked, however due to various reasons these where always built with varying website builders such as GoDaddy, Wix and WordPress. For my personal project I decided to use HTML5 & CSS3 to showcase my skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>The beginning of the website coding went well however, after wanting to code in vanilla HTML5 & CSS3 only, I came across an issue that was not going well this way. After researching and looking into it with various methods, I came to the conclusion of bringing in some JavaScript for functionality but as little as possible. This allowed me to accomplish the filtering system that is used on the Projects Page in order for users to filter the elements by tags such as Hardware, Software, Networking, Coding or Other.</p>

                    <p>In this Portfolio Website project, I have had to utilise my project management skills, coding and networking skills to get this up and running successfully. It has also helped me grow and develop these skills along the way and given me that experience of developing a website from scratch with just a blank page, and seeing it through to fruition from design, development and then pushing through to production.</p>

                    <p>The website will be updated and maintained by myself as I delve deeper into my journey into the technology industry.</p>

                            <h4>HTML5</h4>
                            <p>HTML5 was used as the base of this website. It is used to add content and certain formatting onto the page that the web browser can translate and show to the user.</p>

                            <h4>CSS3</h4>
                            <p>CSS3 is used to style the website. I have used various techniques to style various elements including creating variables, calc() elements, modals and responsive design using media queries.</p>

                            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                            <p>I don’t have much experience in JavaScript and have had to do some additional research on this to help add certain functionality to the website. To accomplish the working filter element on the Projects page, I needed to implement this into my code. By using JavaScript, users can filter element based on a data-attribute linked to each project card. This will then only display the relevant cards and hide the remaining dependant on the selection of the user. </p>

                            <p>To host the website, I decided to use GitHub, more specifically GitHub Pages. This allows for a free static website to be hosted on a reputable and reliable server with great uptime, provided it is under 1GB in size. For this project at the moment that suits these needs. It may differ in the future dependant on the needs of the website. </p>

                            <p>VS Code was used as my code editor for this project. It is a fully functional IDE with many plugins that are very useful for coding projects. One such extension is Live Server which allow for the deployment of a temporary local server, so that changes can be seen in real time for the developer, streamlining the process.</p>
