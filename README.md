# [Portfolio-Website](https://sjs404.github.io)

I have decided to put my limited coding skills to good use, by developing and deploying my portfolio website, using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

I come from a background in the hospitality field and have always had more of an interest in the hardware side of IT. Building and repairing systems is rather therapeutic to me, but software i had never really delved into deeply until recently. I decided at the end of 2021 to leave the hospitality industry after 15+ years and pursue my passions in the field.
